Begin by clicking on “Create Authentication” once you login to the dashboard.\n![RNALab 2](images/RNA/2-1.png)\n\nIn the top right corner, press the purple rectangle labeled “Create Authentication”.\n\n- Name: NMS_connect\n- Description: *leave blank*\n- Service: SevOne\n- Protocol: https://\n- Host: 10.0.0.10\n- Username: admin\n- Password: SevOne\n- API key: *leave blank*\n\n![RNALab 2](images/RNA/2-2.png)\n\nClick \"create\"\n\n## Step 2: \nNavigate to the “WORKFLOWS” tab at the top of your screen to the left of your current tab, “AUTHENTICATIONS”. Then, click “Create Workflow” in the top right corner.\n![RNALab 2](images/RNA/2-3.png)\n\nTitle the workflow “Lab2” and keep the Layout type as “Flow”. You can leave the description blank and press “Create”. \n\n## Step 3:\nLet’s add our first building block. Do this by first navigating to the left-hand menu, scrolling down until you see “SevOne”, and select. The flow should be [ SevOne > RESTv3 > Metadata > Metadata Devices (POST) ]\n\nYou’ll need to change the authentication key to the one we created in Step 1. Once you’ve added your first block, select “admin/NMS_connect” from the dropdown next to “authKey”.\n![RNALab 2](images/RNA/2-4.png)\n\n## Step 4:\nNow, add a ForEach loop after the SevOne block we just made. Select “Home” at the very top of the left-hand navigation bar to return to the initial menu. Select [ Common > ForEach] and add the block.\n\nOnce you’ve added your ForEach block, edit the value next to the variable “list” to be $SevOne_1.result.devices \n\n*If you changed the name of the building block, please use the current name for the variable.*\n![RNALab 2](images/RNA/2-5.png)\n\n## Step 5:\nInside the loop, let’s add an IF building block. To do this, navigate back “Home” on the toolbar and select [ Common > If ] and add the block.\n\nThe condition will be: $ForEach_1.item.ip == ‘127.0.0.1’\n\n*Be sure to write it manually — it may give you an error if you try and copy and paste the conditon into the value box.*\n![RNALab 2](images/RNA/2-6.png)\n\n## Step 6:\nInside the TRUE branch of the If, add a new building block by selecting [ Common > Assign ] and dragging it under the TRUE branch.\n\nYou can either add a new Assign block or move the one below it already in your flow (Assign_1) and modify it, like it's shown here.\n\nThe variable will be: $result | The value will be: $ForEach_1.item.name \n![RNALab 2](images/RNA/2-7.png)\n\n## Step 7:\nSave and Run the workflow. The expected result: “NMS”\n![RNALab 2](images/RNA/2-8.png)\n\n[Optional] Try a different criteria to search inside the If — change the IP address from “127.0.0.1” to “172.24.148.2”. The expected result: “CHI-SW01”\n![RNALab 2](images/RNA/2-9.png)","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"5209e8d8073740d02810e1974974d5f3","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":1987},"frontmatter":{"title":"RNALab2"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: RNALab2\n---\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    RNA Lab 2 - Logic Lab <br />\n  </span>\n);\n;\n\n## Step 1: \nFirst we need to create authentication to connect to NMS.
