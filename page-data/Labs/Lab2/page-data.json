The manager wants to make sure there is no problem now.\n\nOn top of this, the network manager wants to review if there is any SLA being breached in any of their offices, just to make sure everything in the network is \nrunning smoothly.\n\n## Step 0:\n\nMake sure environment access is set up (check the SevOne Lab Environment Tab)\n* Full Demo Video Located in the Uncut Lab Videos Tab\n\n## Step 1:\n\n<video controls poster=\"/images/VideoCover.png\" style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/ExecRep/ExecReport2.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\nFrom the SevOne homepage, open the Executive Report file using the search bar.\n\n![Lab 2](images/2.1.png)\n\nUpon entering the file, your screen should look like this:\n\n![Lab 2](images/2.2.png)\n\nThis is a dashboard to show you a big picture view of your service status. \nOn the top two panels, you can see the health of your services, and on the bottom two, you can see the availability of the services.\n\n## Step 2:\n\n<video controls poster=\"/images/VideoCover.png\" style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/ExecRep/ExecReport3.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\nFocus in on the health of the services panel on the top left. As you can see, the Pulsar application is having some issues. \nSelect the Pulsar icon to drill down into the service.\n\n![Lab 2](images/2.3.png)\n\nOnce you select this, the dashboard becomes specific to the Pulsar application. \nIf you look at the graph on the top right, you can see the times that there were problems with the service. \nThe availability goes down at night, which is normal, but during the day it is a problem.\n\n![Lab 2](images/2.4.png)\n\n## Step 3:\n\n<video controls poster=\"/images/VideoCover.png\" style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/ExecRep/ExecReport4.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\nTo drill down to get more information, go to the Availability Service panel in the bottom left. \nClick Pulsar in Device Name and then select Business Application Report.\n\n![Lab 2](images/2.5.png)\n\nHere you can click through the different views of the application report, including Status, Availability, WAN, IPSLA, and more, depending on \nwhat information you are looking for exactly. Take some time to see the different views.\n\nWe are going to jump to the Traffic page.\n\n![Lab 2](images/2.6.png)\n\nThe points of high traffic utilization might explain why there was poor health during the day on this service.\n\n## Step 4:\n\n<video controls poster=\"/images/VideoCover.png\" style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/ExecRep/ExecReport5.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\nNow we are going to look at the system’s WAN status. \nIn the upper left-hand corner, underneath the title Business Application Report, click the link to take you back to the main dashboard for the Executive Report. \nOnce you’re there, click on the Global WAN Report page. \n\n![Lab 2](images/2.7.png)\n\nHere you can see a map of your network, where you are able to view primary and secondary connections. \nWe’re just going to focus on primary connections, so you can deselect secondary.\n\nThe map will show the overall status of the WAN health for each office, as well as the status of the links. \nWith the green/orange/red markers, we can easily identify if there is a problem with that office or link at that point in time.\n\nThe heatmap down below allows us to see historical data and if there was any problem in the past. \nThe red blocks show problems in the past at the Chicago office.\n\n![Lab 2](images/2.8.png)\n\n## Step 5:\n\n<video controls poster=\"/images/VideoCover.png\" style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/ExecRep/ExecReport6.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\nTo drill down further, click CHI in the WAN Health panel and select Global WAN Health.\n\n![Lab 2](images/2.9.png)\n\nOnce you do that, you view should look like this:\n\n![Lab 2](images/2.10.png)\n\nHere you get a side-by-side view of the problems in the CHI office on the left, and then the reasons for those problems on the right.\nNOTE: depending on the time of the day, the applications generating spikes might be different.\n\n## Step 6:\n\n<video controls poster=\"/images/VideoCover.png\" style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/ExecRep/ExecReport7.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\nNow click on WAN Quality. Your view should look like this:\n\n![Lab 2](images/2.11.png)\n\nTo calculate the WAN health we use several indicators, including IPSLA quality, errors, etc.\nThis view shows that there was also a problem with one of the IPSLA, also impacting on the health of the WAN network on that office.\n\nTo drill down even further, click on events. Your view should look like this:\n\n![Lab 2](images/2.12.png)\n\nHere we can review the actual events that have happened on the WAN network of that office.\n\n## Step 7:\n\n<video controls poster=\"/images/VideoCover.png\" style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/ExecRep/ExecReport8.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\nThe last thing we are going to do is get a view of the overall health of the network. \nOnce again, click link to take you back to the main dashboard for the Executive Report, and then click WAN Capacity. \nYour view should look like this:\n\n![Lab 2](images/2.13.png)\n\nThe view defaults to show you the last 24 hours, but to be even more specific, we will choose to see the last 8 hours. \nIt shows the average traffic utilization as well as the peak traffic utilization in this timeframe, to help us identify any congestion.\n\n## Step 8:\n\n<video controls poster=\"/images/VideoCover.png\" style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/ExecRep/ExecReport9.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\nNow look at Office Health.\n\n![Lab 2](images/2.14.png)\n\nHere you can see a high-level view of the number of events per office, giving you an idea of which regions are having more problems that the others. \nIt also shows top devices by response time, CPU, and connections, giving us an idea of how busy the devices are.\n\nClick in on one of the offices to see the widgets propagate the data specific to that location.\n\n![Lab 2](images/2.15.png)\n\n\nWe now have seen a broad view of the capabilities of SevOne to show you your network health.\n\n## Summary/Additional Questions:\n\n<video controls poster=\"/images/VideoCover.png\" style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/ExecRep/ExecReport10.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"c9dc7a2361f62e17b85989deaffd8a39","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":224},"frontmatter":{"0":"e","1":"x","2":"p","3":"o","4":"r","5":"t","6":" ","7":"c","8":"o","9":"n","10":"s","11":"t","12":" ","13":"T","14":"i","15":"t","16":"l","17":"e","18":" ","19":"=","20":" ","21":"(","22":")","23":" ","24":"=","25":">","26":" ","27":"(","28":" ","29":"<","30":"s","31":"p","32":"a","33":"n","34":">","35":" ","36":"L","37":"a","38":"b","39":" ","40":"2","41":" ","42":"-","43":" ","44":"E","45":"x","46":"e","47":"c","48":"u","49":"t","50":"i","51":"v","52":"e","53":" ","54":"R","55":"e","56":"p","57":"o","58":"r","59":"t","60":" ","61":"<","62":"b","63":"r","64":" ","65":"/","66":">","67":" ","68":"<","69":"/","70":"s","71":"p","72":"a","73":"n","74":">","75":" ","76":")","77":";","description":"Labs / Lab 2","title":"Labs / Lab 2"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\nexport const Title = () => (\n  <span>\n    Lab 2 - Executive Report <br />\n  </span>\n);\n---\n\n**Demo Overview:**\n<video controls poster=\"/images/VideoCover.png\" style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/ExecRep/ExecReport1.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\nThis demo shows how we can create executive/managerial reports in SevOne in a way that the audience can easily understand\nthe status of the network and can control and maintain the SLAs.\n\nFor a background on this specific hypothetical situation, a network manager wants to review the current status of the network because there were some problems \nyesterday with one of the internal services.
