Now, the company deployed SevOne and we are\ntrying to identify the root cause of the MS Teams issue. Reviewing every single KPI that can\nimpact that application, we will find out why the issue occurred and how to fix it.\n\nUse Cases: \n\nAll the Data \n\n•Maps – data simplification \n\n•Object groups \n\n•Routing protocols – Device certification \n\n•Network quality \n\n•Netflow – bandwidth analysis \n\n•QoS – Device certification \n\n•MPLS – Device certification \n\n\nBackup Issue - Data Correlation \n\n•Metric to flow \n\n•Workflow \n\n\nMS Teams Issue - Root cause analysis \n\n•High Frequency Polling \n\n•Baseline \n\n\n## Step 1:\n\n<video controls style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/WAN/WANVideo02.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\n![Lab 3](/images/WAN/pic10.png)\n\nGo to Global Internet Health - Operational Report. Switch the timeframe to view the last 48 hours.\n\n•Internet monitoring is not only traffic monitoring and errors, it is more than that \n\n•This reports shows everything that might be relevant to troubleshoot WAN issues \n\n•Change location easily using Sites filter (object group) \n\n•Easy visualization using Maps and chaining \n\n(Dev note - add tab explanations to screenshots below)\n![Lab

\n![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic16.png)\nGo back to snapshot and look at jittr \n\nTalking Points: \n\n•Some issues with IPSLA (link performance) have been identified \n\n•These issues might or might not be related to the MS teams problem \n\n•Time to start troubleshooting and correlate data \n\n## Step 3\n<video controls style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/WAN/WANVideo04.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\nGo to Quality and Reachability section  \n![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic5.png)\nTalking Points: \n\n•There are some problems with MOS and Jitter at the same time \n\n•We can give indications of the meaning of the KPIs within the report (see Explanation widget) \n\n•The question is why is this happening? \n\n## Step 4\n<video controls style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/WAN/WANVideo05.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\nGo to Internet Connections\n![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic12.png)\nTalking Points: \n\n•There is a spike of traffic that looks like it is at the same time as the issues with performance \n\n•We need to make sure these two issues are related \n\nClick on HC Out Octets within the Traffic widget \n\nGo to Instant Graph Workspace \n![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic13.png)\nChoose \n\n•Device: CHI-EDGE01 \n\n•Objects: GigabitEthernet1/1/0/0 and jitter -_-CHI_to_SFO-1-Index:111-Tos:0 \n\n•Indicators: Total HC Octets and MOS \n![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic14.png)\nTalking Points: \n\n•Very easy to see that both issues are correlated \n\n•Because of the saturation of the link, the quality of the link drops \n\n•But we still need to know why there is saturation \n\n## Step 5\n<video controls style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/WAN/WANVideo06.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\nClick + and select Flow \n\nChange Flow view to Application Names \n![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic15.png)\nTalking Points: \n\n•The ability to link metric with flow data allows us to easily identify that the problem is the spike of SQL traffic \n\n•Hence, we have identified one issue, but this does not look related to the original MS Teams issue that we were reviewing \n\nClick on Global Internet Report – Operational Report breadcrumb to go back to the main report \n\nReview QoS alert \n![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic16.png)\nTalking Points: \n\n•There is a problem with a priority QoS class having drops \n\n•We are not generating alerts on every single class, only on those ones that are important/critical \n\n•Let’s review the impact of this alert \n\n## Step 6\n<video controls style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/WAN/WANVideo07.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\nGo to QoS sections\n![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic17.png)\nTalking Points: \n\n•There is a spike of priority class traffic that is generating some drops \n\n•There are also some drops related to best effort traffic that are not relevant \n\n•We need to identify what kind of traffic is generating that spike \n\nGo to Internet Connections section. \n![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic12.png)\n\n## Step 7\n<video controls style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/WAN/WANVideo08.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\nGo to BW Analysis section.\n![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic18.png)\nTalking Points: \n\n•At the time of the issue there is an application that generated more traffic than normal \n\n•Let’s identify that application \n\nSelect MS Teams\n![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic19.png)\nTalking Points: \n\n•There is a short term spike of MS Teams traffic that may have generated the issue as it may have reached the max BW assigned to the QoS class assigned \n\n•However we need more detailed information, because microburst could be another reason why there are QoS drops \n\n## Step 8\n<video controls style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/WAN/WANVideo09.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\nGo to Internet Connections  \n\nZoom in on the time of the spike (as much as possible) \n![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic20.png)\nTalking Points: \n\n•Using our high frequency polling we can detect short term bursts of traffic, giving us more detailed information that would be missed if we were monitoring every 5 minutes \n\nClick on HC In Octets and choose Data Analytics\n![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic21.png)\nTalking Points: \n\n•SevOne can tell us the normal behavior of any monitored metric \n\n•Here we can see that the microburst is not normal, but the SQL traffic that we saw before actually happens every day \n\n## Step 9\n<video controls style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n
