Now, the company deployed SevOne and we are\ntrying to identify the root cause of the MS Teams issue. Reviewing every single KPI that can\nimpact that application, we will find out why the issue occurred and how to fix it.\n\n**Use Cases:**\n* All the Data \n  * Maps – data simplification \n  * Object groups \n  * Routing protocols – Device certification \n  * Network quality \n  * Netflow – bandwidth analysis \n  * QoS – Device certification \n  * MPLS – Device certification \n* Backup Issue - Data Correlation \n  * Metric to flow \n  * Workflow \n* MS Teams Issue - Root cause analysis \n  * High Frequency Polling \n  * Baseline \n\n## Step 0:\n\nLogin to the SevOne lab environment as referenced in the SevOne Lab Environment Tab\n\nFull Demo Video Located in the Uncut Lab Videos Tab\n\n## Step 1:\n\n<video controls poster=\"/images/VideoCover.png\" style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>\n  <source src=\"/videos/WAN/WANVideo02.mp4\"/>\n</video>\n\nGo to Global Internet Health - Operational Report.
