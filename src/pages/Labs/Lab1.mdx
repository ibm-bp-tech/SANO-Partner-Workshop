## Step 1: 

We will go through an example process of diagnosing high cpu usage. 

Make your way to demo.sevone.com.

Then search for Network Performance report in the top right.

![Lab 1](images/1.1.png)

Navigate to Active Alerts.

Make sure the time period is set to Past 48 Hours as shown here.

![Lab 1](images/1.2.png)

## Step 2:

Go to device groups in the top left.

Search for P1 as shown below

![Lab 1](images/1.3.png)

Now we can check out the most severe alerts.

Look for the Chicago Firewall alert and click on the CISCO summary.

## Step 3:

Navigate to the connections tab and notice the drops on the graph as shown here.

![Lab 1](images/1.5.png)

Check out some of the other tabs until you get to the CPU window. 

Notice that the cpu has similar spikes as seen before. 

Click on the graph spike and navigate to the Instant Graphs Workspace.

## Step 4:

Once you see the CPU screen add the connections object like so.

![Lab 1](images/1.7.png)

Everything will go blank, just add the 5 minute average and current connections as indicators.

![Lab 1](images/1.8.png)

Now we can see the correlation between a drop in connections and high cpu usage.

## Step 5:

Navigate back a page. 

![Lab 1](images/1.10.png)

Then move over to the processes tab.

![Lab 1](images/1.11.png)

## Step 6: 

Order the CPU Time graph by max to check which process uses the most time. 

![Lab 1](images/1.12.png)

Click on the average CPU time for the SSL process

![Lab 1](images/1.13.png)

## Step 7: 

It is evident that the spikes on the graph are not normal.

![Lab 1](images/1.14.png)

So now that we know that high cpu is generated from the SSL processes. We can
google some possible reasons for this.

Enter the following into google chrome.

![Lab 1](images/1.15.png)

After clicking on the first link we get this answer:

![Lab 1](images/1.16.png)

So we can see that SYN attacks could be the cause for high cpu.

Let's investigate further.

## Step 8:

Navigate to the Flow tab at the very right.

![Lab 1](images/1.17.png)

At the bottom we have a Denial of Service graph. Where we can see
a large amount of TCP/SYN packets.

![Lab 1](images/1.18.png)

So we have found the culprit.

## Step 9:

To make sure we have the right answer, navigate to the connections tab.

![Lab 1](images/1.19.png)

Then configure the graph as shown below.

![Lab 1](images/1.20.png)

We can now see a direct correlation between the spikes and drops on both graphs.

![Lab 1](images/1.21.png)

So we have determined the cause of high cpu usage.
