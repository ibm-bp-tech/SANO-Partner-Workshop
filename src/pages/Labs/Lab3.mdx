## Lab Overview

This lab will show how we can monitor the internet connections from a holistic
approach, not only monitoring internet traffic, but getting visibility from every single aspect of
the network that could impact the internet connections, from BGP connections to MPLS traffic,
from QoS drops to bandwidth analysis

## Setting the Stage

Recently there have been some issues with MS Teams; however, in the past it has been very
difficult to troubleshoot these problems. Now, the company deployed SevOne and we are
trying to identify the root cause of the MS Teams issue. Reviewing every single KPI that can
impact that application, we will find out why the issue occurred and how to fix it.

Use Cases: 

All the Data 

•Maps – data simplification 

•Object groups 

•Routing protocols – Device certification 

•Network quality 

•Netflow – bandwidth analysis 

•QoS – Device certification 

•MPLS – Device certification 


Backup Issue - Data Correlation 

•Metric to flow 

•Workflow 


MS Teams Issue - Root cause analysis 

•High Frequency Polling 

•Baseline

![Lab 3](/images/WAN/pic10.png)

Go to Global Internet Health - Operational Report. Switch the timeframe to view the last 48 hours.

•Internet monitoring is not only traffic monitoring and errors, it is more than that 

•This reports shows everything that might be relevant to troubleshoot WAN issues 

•Change location easily using Sites filter (object group) 

•Easy visualization using Maps and chaining

## Step 2:
<video controls style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>
  <source src="/videos/WAN/WANVideo03.mp4"/>
</video>

Back to Main page and focus on Issue: 
![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic16.png)
Go back to snapshot and look at jittr 

Talking Points: 

•Some issues with IPSLA (link performance) have been identified 

•These issues might or might not be related to the MS teams problem 

•Time to start troubleshooting and correlate data 

## Step 3
<video controls style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>
  <source src="/videos/WAN/WANVideo04.mp4"/>
</video>

Go to Quality and Reachability section  
![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic5.png)
Talking Points: 

•There are some problems with MOS and Jitter at the same time 

•We can give indications of the meaning of the KPIs within the report (see Explanation widget) 

•The question is why is this happening? 

## Step 4
<video controls style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>
  <source src="/videos/WAN/WANVideo05.mp4"/>
</video>

Go to Internet Connections
![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic12.png)
Talking Points: 

•There is a spike of traffic that looks like it is at the same time as the issues with performance 

•We need to make sure these two issues are related 

Click on HC Out Octets within the Traffic widget 

Go to Instant Graph Workspace 
![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic13.png)
Choose 

•Device: CHI-EDGE01 

•Objects: GigabitEthernet1/1/0/0 and jitter -_-CHI_to_SFO-1-Index:111-Tos:0 

•Indicators: Total HC Octets and MOS 
![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic14.png)
Talking Points: 

•Very easy to see that both issues are correlated 

•Because of the saturation of the link, the quality of the link drops 

•But we still need to know why there is saturation 

## Step 5
<video controls style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>
  <source src="/videos/WAN/WANVideo06.mp4"/>
</video>

Click + and select Flow 

Change Flow view to Application Names 
![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic15.png)
Talking Points: 

•The ability to link metric with flow data allows us to easily identify that the problem is the spike of SQL traffic 

•Hence, we have identified one issue, but this does not look related to the original MS Teams issue that we were reviewing

Review QoS alert 
![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic16.png)
Talking Points: 

•There is a problem with a priority QoS class having drops 

•We are not generating alerts on every single class, only on those ones that are important/critical 

•Let’s review the impact of this alert 

## Step 6
<video controls style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>
  <source src="/videos/WAN/WANVideo07.mp4"/>
</video>

Go to QoS sections
![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic17.png)
Talking Points: 

•There is a spike of priority class traffic that is generating some drops 

•There are also some drops related to best effort traffic that are not relevant 

•We need to identify what kind of traffic is generating that spike 

Go to Internet Connections section. 
![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic12.png)

## Step 7
<video controls style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>
  <source src="/videos/WAN/WANVideo08.mp4"/>
</video>

Go to BW Analysis section.
![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic18.png)
Talking Points: 

•At the time of the issue there is an application that generated more traffic than normal 

•Let’s identify that application 

Select MS Teams
![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic19.png)
Talking Points: 

•There is a short term spike of MS Teams traffic that may have generated the issue as it may have reached the max BW assigned to the QoS class assigned 

•However we need more detailed information, because microburst could be another reason why there are QoS drops 

## Step 8
<video controls style={{ width: `50%`, height: `50%`}}>
  <source src="/videos/WAN/WANVideo09.mp4"/>
</video>

Go to Internet Connections  

Zoom in on the time of the spike (as much as possible) 
![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic20.png)
Talking Points: 

•Using our high frequency polling we can detect short term bursts of traffic, giving us more detailed information that would be missed if we were monitoring every 5 minutes 

Click on HC In Octets and choose Data Analytics
![Lab 3](images/WAN/pic21.png)
Talking Points: 

•SevOne can tell us the normal behavior of any monitored metric 

•Here we can see that the microburst is not normal, but the SQL traffic that we saw before actually happens every day
